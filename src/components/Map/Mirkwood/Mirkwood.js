      <p> Mirkwood was the greatest forest of Middle-earth, located in the eastern region of Rhovanion between the Grey Mountains and Gondor.
        It was also known as Greenwood the Great, Eryn Galen, or Taur-e-Ndaedelos, and at the end of the Third Age was renamed Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves.</p>
