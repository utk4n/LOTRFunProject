      <p>Lothlórien, also known as Lórien, was a forest and Elven realm near the lower Misty Mountains. It was first settled by Nandorin Elves, but they were later joined by a small number of Ñoldor and Sindar under Celeborn of Doriath and Galadriel, daughter of Finarfin. It was located on the River Celebrant, southeast of Khazad-dûm, and was the only place in Middle-earth where the golden Mallorn trees grew.</p>
