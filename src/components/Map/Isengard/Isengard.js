      <p> Isengard, also known as Angrenost ('Iron Fortress') in Sindarin, was one of the three major fortresses of Gondor, and held within it one of the realm's palant√≠ri.
        However, in the latter half of the Third Age, the stronghold came into the possession of Saruman, becoming his home and personal domain until his defeat in the War of the Ring.</p>
